        <h3>If I get stopped by a police officer, do I, as a permit holder, have to tell the officer that I have a gun in my possession?</h3>
        <div class="faq-aside">
          <p>Although there is no legal requirement to identify yourself to a law enforcement officer, it is recommended to do so.</p>
          <p>If an officer finds or sees a gun on your person during their contact with you, and you have not identified yourself as a permit holder in legal possession of a firearm, the officer may assume you are carrying the gun illegally and may take defensive action. For the safety of all involved, it is recommended to immediately identify yourself to the officer as a permit holder in possession of a handgun. This action gives the officer some assurance they are most likely dealing with a law abiding citizen.</p>

        <h3>Is there any way that I can check to see if my criminal history will prevent me from obtaining a concealed firearm permit BEFORE I go through the whole process of applying?</h3>
        <div class="faq-aside">
          <p>Yes. You can go to the BCI or call by phone and ask to speak with one of the investigators. If you explain to the investigator what type of problem you have had, he can give you a good idea whether you qualify for a concealed firearm permit or not.</p>

        <h3>As a permit holder, exactly, where can I carry or not carry a handgun?</h3>
        <div class="faq-aside">
          <p>The concealed firearm permit allows an individual to carry a firearm fully loaded and concealed.  The permit also allows an individual to carry a firearm into public schools. Permit holders can not carry a firearm into federal or state restricted areas i.e. any airport secured area, federal facilities, courts, correctional & mental health facilities, law enforcement secured areas, a house of worship or private residence where notice given and/or posted, any secured area in which firearms are prohibited and notice posted, or otherwise prohibited by state of federal law.</p>
